# Stability-of-the-Electric-Grid-System
Electrical grids require a balance between electricity supply and demand in order to be stable. Conventional systems achieve this balance through demand-driven electricity production. For future grids with a high share of inflexible (i.e., renewable) energy source, the concept of demand response is a promising solution. This implies changes in electricity consumption in relation to electricity price changes. In this work, weâ€™ll build a binary classification model to predict if a grid is stable or unstable using the UCI Electrical Grid Stability Simulated dataset.
